# Simple Calculator App

This is a simple calculator app that allows the user to compute simple arithmetics involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and exponentiation of numbers. 

The main goal of this mini-project is to familiarize with Python and GUI with Tkinter. 

I followed a [tkinter tutorial from freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXPyB4XeYLA&t=4729s) and implemented additional features such as exponentiation, color theme, decimal points and exceptions to create a more robust calculator. 

This project is incomplete - I plan to further implement the application to store a couple of most recent calculations and add persistence to keep it even after restarting the application; add more operations such as modulo %, parenthesis (), trig functions, and more (and change the name to "ADVANCED Calculator").
