# Simple Calculator App

This is a simple calculator app that allows the user to compute simple arithmetics involving addition, subtraciton, multiplication, divison and exponentiation of numbers. 

The main goal of this mini-project is to familiarize with Python and GUI with Tkinter. 

I followed a tkinter tutorial from freeCodeCamp.org and implemented additional features such as exponentiation, color theme, decimal points, tests and exceptions to create a more robust calculator.
